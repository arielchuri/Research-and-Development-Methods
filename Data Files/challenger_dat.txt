NASA Challenger Disaster Data
Launch Date = January 28, 1986
Projected Temperature = 31 degrees F
Source--Edward Tufte Handout & NASA & Morton Thiokol
Number of Observations = 24
Number of Variables per line image = 4
Order of Variables on a line image--
    1. Response 1 = Number of Failed O-Rings (0, 1, 2, or 3)
    2. Response 2 = Type of Failure (0 = No Damage
                                     1 = Primary O-Ring Heating
                                     2 = Primary O-Ring Erosion
                                     3 = Primary O-Ring Blowby
                                     4 = Secondary O-Ring Heating
    3. Factor 1 = Flight ID (1 to 24)
    4. Factor 2 = Temperature
