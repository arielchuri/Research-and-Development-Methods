# Perception Analysis 2
Analysis and synthesis are key to interpreting collected data in design research scenarios. Though designers are sometimes able to identify key insights through intuition during research, tools for analysis offer a comprehensive method for distilling and extracting important information to be used in a design response. 
 
Form groups of 6-7 people. Using the data accumulated by you and the rest of the group, as closely as is possible, go through the following steps (skipping 3 and 5) of analysis and synthesis as described by Steve Baty in *Deconstructing Analysis Techniques*. 
 
1. Deconstruction 
2. Manipulation 
3. Transformation [skip this step] 
4. Summarization 
5. Aggregation [skip this step] 
6. Generalization 
7. Abstraction 
8. Synthesis 
 
You should distill the data into useful design information and insights about the MTA bus system and users. Document each step, and consider the outcome of your synthesis as a brief for design concept development.  
 
Once you’ve finished, work individually to come up with a new breakthrough design for the MTA bus system. Create a PDF documenting your interviews/bus photos, each analysis step, and your new breakthrough design. 
 
Your personal analysis­synthesis and design PDF must be uploaded to Canvas and the class share folder before the following class.
