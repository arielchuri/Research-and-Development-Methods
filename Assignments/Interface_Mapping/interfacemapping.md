Read The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1

Choose one of the five products below (each one will present different opportunities and challenges).
Your product should have at least seven features (use the ones listed or make reasonable substitutions).
Create a paper prototype in phase 1 and a cardboard prototype with the controls drawn on in phase 2. Take photographs and combine them into a PDF.
Justify why your interface design is desirable and easy to use (use call-outs pointing to each feature). 

The model should be as close to actual size as possible.

Assessment Criteria
These are the things that I will be looking for in your interface designs.
Utilize Norman’s principles of “design for usability” and “natural mapping” in your design (see chapter 1).
Your interface should communicate a good mental model for how your product works (not just look cool).
Use spatial relationships, affordances, constraints, and feedback mechanisms to suggest proper usage.
Upload a PDF of your product drawing to both Canvas and Google drive before class and be ready to discuss your design decisions. Bring in your prototype.
