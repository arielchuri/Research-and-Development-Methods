When you go out in the field, your behavior as a researcher will affect the reputation of the New School and of the research community at large. Not only that, but as a researcher, you are responsible for informing your subjects of their rights and of guarding those rights closely. Getting the data is never more important than assuring a good experience for the subjects.

# TIPS FOR CONDUCTING ETHICAL RESEARCH

**MISREPRESENTATION**  
Do not misrepresent yourself or your project in the field: inform the subject that you are a student researcher working on a project. Even better: wear a lanyard indicating who you are and what you are doing. If telling the subject specifically what you are working on may bias the data, speak in accurate generalities (for example, instead of saying you’re studying Shake Shack, you may say you are studying fast food or outdoor eateries).

**PERMISSION**  
Explain what you are doing, how long it will take, ask permission and wait for consent. Do not pressure the subject. If the subject does not want to participate in your study - even if their rejection is a soft rejection like “I’m not sure I have time” - it is usually best to let it go. Say: “I understand completely and thank you for your time thus far."
**WRITTEN CONSENT** A signed written consent form is required when conducting research not in a public space and always recommended. A consent form shows not only that you’ve received permission, but also informed the participant (that’s why it’s called “informed consent”). Provide a copy of the consent form with your contact information to the participant. There are many consent forms available, but here are their key elements:

1. Explanation of the study and opportunity to ask questions
2. Statement that participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time
3. Information on the types of data you will be gathering (photo, video, audio)
4. Information on how the data will be used (usually, we ask for consent for non-public release within the context of the project, but also you could ask for consent for anonymous public release, etc.).
5. Agreement to participate
6. Signature of participant and their contact information

**PHOTOGRAPHY**  
It is legal to photograph people in public space, but that does not make it ethical. When photographing, do not deliberately conceal the fact from your subjects. If asked by the subject, delete the photos. Even better, print out a sign or wear a lanyard indicating what you are doing and why. For example: “We are New School students conducting research for a project. Questions or concerns - come say hi!"

**VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDING**  
It is legal to video record people in public space and - in New York state - it is also legal to record audio (unless it is of someone on the phone and you can hear the other party - that’s a felony). But again, best practice is to post signs informing people in the space that you are recording and why. Unless audio is absolutely necessary to the data, it is best to either not record audio or delete the audio layer from your recording as soon as you copy the data.

**RESPECT**  
Be courteous and grateful for the time your participants give you. If you are in someone’s home, ask them whether you should remove your shoes. Don’t bring coffee. Let them know you can pause the research at any time if they need a break, have an off-the-record question, or want to take a phone call. Continue to ask for permission (just because they have invited you to their home for an interview does not give you the right to look in their cabinets).
