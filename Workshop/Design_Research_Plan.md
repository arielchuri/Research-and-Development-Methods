# Design Research Plan
## Brief
Our preliminary research has shown that we may be able to enact a series of changes to the implementation and presentation of the MTA bus service in order to increase ridership.
We need create a plan of in-depth research to create our final design. Assuming a budget that allows for two researchers to work for two weeks create a detailed research plan.
+ What are the questions we want to answer? (perception, budgetary, political, etc...)
+ How will you allocate these resources?
  + Create a schedule / gantt chart
+ How will the research data be gathered?
+ How will the data be transformed?
+ What form will the deliverables take?

Produce a gantt chart (google sheet) and google doc to outline your plan.
Be as detailed as possible in the time allowed. Start from a general outline and then begin to fill in the details.
