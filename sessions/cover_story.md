# Cover Story

Create two magazine covers documenting two different visions of the future.

### Bad News
Imagine the worst case scenario if we try to avoid confronting this problem.

1. Draw a rectangle about 1' x 2'. This will be your magazine cover.

     “Cover” tells the BIG story of the problem.
     “Headlines” convey the substance of the cover story.
     “Sidebars” reveal interesting facets of the cover story.
     “Quotes” can be from anyone as long as they’re related to the story.
     “Brainstorm” is for documenting initial ideas for the cover story.
     “Images” are for supporting the content with illustrations.

2. To populate the template you can either select a scribe or write and draw on it together.

3. Imagine the best-case scenario for the agency and take that scenario one step further. Spend five quiet minutes imagining your own stories before you work together to agree on one. You have 20 minutes to generate this “story of the year” and represent it on your template.

### Good News
Imagine we create a government agency that is a resounding success.

1. Draw a rectangle about 1' x 2'. This will be your magazine cover.

     “Cover” tells the BIG story of their success.
     “Headlines” convey the substance of the cover story.
     “Sidebars” reveal interesting facets of the cover story.
     “Quotes” can be from anyone as long as they’re related to the story.

### Present you work

4. Each group 5 minutes to share what they imagined was written in the story and the supporting elements.

5. Note any common vision themes and areas of agreement. Share any observations, insights, and concerns about the future state.
