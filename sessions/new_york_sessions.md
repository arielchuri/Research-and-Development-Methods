# New York Sessions

1. Create a discussion on Canvas about your agency/problem. Quickly describe the problem faced. 

2. Break into new groups and conduct a *Cover Story* design session and *Brainwriting* design session for each of the agency/problems posted.

3. Take a photo of the results of your sessions. Use Google Drive to post a link to your output on each of the discussions.
